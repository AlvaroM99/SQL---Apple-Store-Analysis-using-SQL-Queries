# SQL- AppleStore Querying Analysis

## Overview:
With the increasing market share of the iPhone many app developers see the App Store as a growing and profitable opportunity. According to Statista, there are nearly 4.4 million apps available in the Apple App Store as of July 2020. Even though mobile applications can be a great source of income and a showcase for the developer company and its services, this is still a very competitive field. For this reason, an exploratory analysis of the data can provide useful insights for these developers and the company and thus know what makes an app successful.

For this analysis, I will be using the Kaggle dataset named App Statistics (Apple iOS app store). Data source: [click here]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps)https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps). As a showcase of my SQL skills this exploratory analysis will be done entirely using the [sqlonline]([url](https://sqliteonline.com/)) tool which provides a wide range of engines and an in-engine visualization tool. This time I have selected SQLite engine instead of MySQL due to its better performance and lightweight.
